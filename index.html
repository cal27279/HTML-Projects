    Hello World! This is my practice page<br /> <h1><p style="text-align: center;">Fun with HTML</h1> 
    <p style="text-align: center;"> This is a paragraph</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> I love paragraphs, this is a second paragraph</p>

    <h2>HTML heading tags</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br /> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.<br /> Additionally, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
